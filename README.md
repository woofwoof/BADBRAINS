BAD BRAINS is an attempt to work towards the automated diagnosis of a particularly unfavourable form of an altogether disastrous outcome for any person. Notably, the blight of cancer takes on many guises and no diagnosis, in many ways, is more or less favourable than another. However, to have one’s brain affected through the growth of a tumour can be devastating not only for the affected individual but relatives, friends etc. too. This work aims to use a form of image analysis employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help with the onerous task of tumour diagnosis of affected persons. Through early diagnosis it may then be possible to plan an intervention to reduce the impact of this deadly disease. Moreover, given the pressures upon healthcare systems around the world, increased efficacy of diagnosis will lead to lessening the burden upon already stretched healthcare professionals.
